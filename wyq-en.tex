\section{Internship Experience}

\cventry{2016.6-2016.9}
{Microsoft}
{Android}
{Bing Search on Android}{}
{
Learn Android from scratch, try to participate in project as soon as possible. During internship, I am in charge of some basic features, such as integrating voice SDK, image annotation, extension of browser etc. Besides, I have good communications with colleagues, including other developers, testers, PMs and designs. I can deliver results with high quality in short time.

\section{Project Experience}
%% \subsection{Research Projects}

\cventry{2014--present}
{Alloy Project}
{Java}
{Research Project}{}
{
This project aimed to use Alloy to verify the correctness of distributed controllers. Besides, a modular verification was proposed to accelerate the former verification. Then I leveraged Alloy to dealing with configuration management in cloud platform. For an application scenario, the project provided an verification in Alloy and a deployment using Chef api. I have been working on this project since 2014 all
by myself and the paper have been accepted to QRS '16.

\cventry{2014--2015}
{ConUp Project}
{Java}
{Research Project}{}
{
Working with Guochao Ren, Dong Chen, Ping Su.\\
ConUp is implemented on top of Apache Tuscany, aimed to support dynamic deployment, management and online evolution of components. I mainly contributes to designing and developing the experiment part of ConUp which evaluates the performances of different algorithms.

\cventry{2014}
{KRdecom Project}
{Java}
{Graduation Project}{}
{
An implementation of Krohn-Rhodes decomposition theorem. Besides developing, I also provide unit testing and function testing to guarantee the correctness of implementation, give an analysis of the algorithm's complexity and efficiency and verify them by experimental results.
